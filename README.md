<h1>Stadium game</h1>

<code>
Please generate a single html file containing js and css for a game.
The page should start with a "Start" button which launches an introduction sequence in the theme of star wars with scrolling text (random text will do for now).
After that has finished the user is then required to place a stadium icon (stadium.png) onto a map background (map.jpg). The game then tells them that "that is the wrong place, please try again" before allowing them to retry.
The game never ends.

Can you generate some funny text, for the intro as a parody of the governments 
wreckless decision to host the games in Brisbane and the difficulties they now face placing the stadiums 
and swimming pools and how the player needs to help the government?
